I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://cee.princeton.edu/people/zhiyong-jason-ren">Dr. Jason Ren</a> at the <a href="https://ren.princeton.edu/">Princeton WET Lab</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://stonelab.princeton.edu/">Dr. Howard A. Stone</a> from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Before joining Princeton, I obtained my M.S. degree from Yale University and worked as a full-time research assistant with Drs. <a href="https://elimelechlab.yale.edu/">Menachem Elimelech</a> and <a href="https://pecdevice.yale.edu/">Shu Hu</a>.

My current research focuses on designing advanced materials and developing models to enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of resource recovery from wastewater through data-driven modeling and advanced machine learning techniques. I aim to leverage these innovative approaches to address critical environmental challenges and contribute to sustainable resource management.
