I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://cee.princeton.edu/people/zhiyong-jason-ren">Dr. Jason Ren</a> at <a href="https://ren.princeton.edu/">Princeton WET Lab</a>. I am also closely work with <a href="https://www.bingnano.com/">Dr. Liangbin Hu</a> at University of Maryland. Before joining Princeton, I obtained my M.S. degree from Yale University, and worked as full-time research assistant with Drs. <a href="https://elimelechlab.yale.edu/">Menachem Elimelech</a> and <a href="https://pecdevice.yale.edu/">Shu Hu</a>. 

My current research focuses on designing advanced materials and developing models to enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of resource recovery from wastewater through data-driven modeling and advanced machine learning techniques. I aim to leverage these innovative approaches to address critical environmental challenges and contribute to sustainable resource management.
