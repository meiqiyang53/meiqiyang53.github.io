Pervaporation (PV) is an effective membrane separation process for organic dehydration, recovery, and upgrading. However, it is crucial to improve membrane materials beyond the current permeability-selectivity trade-off. In this research, we introduce machine learning (ML) models to identify high-potential polymers, greatly improving the efficiency and reducing cost compared to conventional trial-and-error approach. We utilized the largest PV data set to date and incorporated polymer fingerprints and features, including membrane structure, operating conditions, and solute properties. Dimensionality reduction, missing data treatment, seed randomness, and data leakage management were employed to ensure model robustness. The optimized LightGBM models achieved RMSE of 0.447 and 0.360 for separation factor and total flux, respectively (logarithmic scale). Screening approximately 1 million hypothetical polymers with ML models resulted in identifying polymers with a predicted permeation separation index >30 and synthetic accessibility score <3.7 for acetic acid extraction. This study demonstrates the promise of ML to accelerate tailored membrane designs.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
