Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NH3) converts an environmental pollutant to a critical nutrient. However, current electrochemical nitrate reduction operations based on monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are limited in NH3 selectivity and catalyst stability, especially in acidic environments. Meanwhile, catalysts with dispersed active sites generally exhibit a higher atomic utilization and distinct activity. Herein, we report a multielement alloy nanoparticle catalyst with dispersed Ru (Ru-MEA) with other synergistic components (Cu, Pd, Pt). Density functional theory elucidated the synergy effect of Ru-MEA than Ru, where a better reactivity (NH3 partial current density of −50.8 mA cm−2) and high NH3 faradaic efficiency (93.5%) is achieved in industrially relevant acidic wastewater. In addition, the Ru- MEA catalyst showed good stability (e.g., 19.0% decay in FENH3 in three hours). This work provides a potential systematic and efficient catalyst discovery process that integrates a data-guided catalyst design and novel catalyst synthesis for a range of applications.

    (a) Proposed NO3− reduction reaction pathway to NH3 on the RuPtPdCu (111) surface. In the figure, the gray, orange, purple, yellow, blue, red, and white balls represent Pd, Ru, Pt, Cu, N, O, and H atoms, respectively. (b) DFT predicted the adsorption energy as compared to the adsorption energy predicted by the linear regression model, which links the local chemical environment of the surface sites and NH adsorption energy. The inset shows that an NH is adsorbed on a surface site on RuPtPdCu (111) containing the three nearest neighboring metal atoms (i.e., the blue balls marked with “1”) and three second-neighboring metal atoms (i.e., the yellow balls marked with “2”). (c) Predicted free energy evolution for NO3− to NH3 (blue line), NO2− (red line), and N2 (green line). In this figure, the NO3− reduction intermediates highlighted by the blue shadow are dispersed in the electrolyte, and the NO3− reduction intermediates highlighted by the green, orange, and purple shadows are adsorbed on a bridge site, hollow site, and top site on RuPtPdCu (111), respectively.
