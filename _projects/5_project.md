I have developed evaporation rate model for environmental conditions including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation based on energy balance at water-air interface for both 2D and 3D scenarios.

<div class="caption">
    Yearly evaporation rate.

We also developed evaporation model based on 3D evaporator.
