• Design an efficient and self-concentrating crystallization method for the selective ex-
traction of lithium from oil and shale gas brines with low Li concentration;

• Synthesize 3D fiber crystallizers with tunable porosity and surface properties

• Develop flow rate model and evaporation model

• Achieve Li selectivity among other co-exist ions by orders of magnitude;

• Uncover the mechanism of crystallization from both theory and simulation.

Characterizations of fiber crystallizer. (A) Fabrication process of fiber crystallizer. (B) EDX mapping detected a homogenous distribution of Cu on fabricated fiber crystallizer. (C) Free surface energy diagram for treated fiber crystallizers. (D) Porosity and cross-section area distribution for crystallizers with different twist intensities (TIs). (E) Porosity and cross-section area distribution for crystallizers fabricated with different number of fiber strings.
