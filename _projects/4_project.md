---

• Design an efficient and self-concentrating crystallization method for the selective ex-
traction of lithium from oil and shale gas brines with low Li concentration;

• Synthesize 3D fiber crystallizers with tunable porosity and surface properties

• Develop flow rate model and evaporation model

• Achieve Li selectivity among other co-exist ions by orders of magnitude;

• Uncover the mechanism of crystallization from both theory and simulation.
